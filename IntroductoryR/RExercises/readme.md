# Introduction to R Exercises
R examples from video series teaching R on <a href = "http://youtube.com/@DesignCodeDebugRepeat">Design Code Debug Repeat</a>.

To run these exercises, you should install whatever libraries are needed for the code from the video (e.g. readr, tidyverse, etc.), and then please install learnr and gradethis.

You can install learnr in the usual way:
install.packages("learnr")

To install gradethis, type the following at the console:
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/gradethis")

The exercises are in projects with all of the necessary support files.  Download the project folder, choose "Open project" in RStudio, open the project, and then double-click on the file with the ".Rmd" extension.

You can then choose "Run Document" in the bar at the head of the document.
